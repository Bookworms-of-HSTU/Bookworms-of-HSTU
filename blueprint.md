# Application Blueprint

## Overview

This is a comprehensive school management system that includes a public-facing website and a secure admin panel. The public website will feature pages for the school's mission, gallery, committee, magazines, and contact information. The admin panel will allow authorized users to manage the content of these pages.

## Implemented Features

### Design and Styling
- **Global Styles**: A global stylesheet (`app/globals.css`) has been created to define a consistent color scheme, typography, and layout for the entire application.
- **Modern Design**: The application uses a modern design aesthetic with a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Custom Components**: Reusable UI components have been created for navigation, headers, footers, and other common elements.

### Load More Functionality

- **Notices**: The notices page now includes a "Load More" button to load and display older notices and news items.
- **Gallery**: The gallery has been enhanced with a "Load More" button to progressively load and display more image galleries.
