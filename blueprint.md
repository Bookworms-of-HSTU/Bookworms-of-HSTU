# Application Blueprint

## Overview

This is a comprehensive school management system that includes a public-facing website and a secure admin panel. The public website will feature pages for the school's mission, gallery, committee, magazines, and contact information. The admin panel will allow authorized users to manage the content of these pages.

## Implemented Features

- **Modern Design**: The application uses a modern design aesthetic with a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Custom Components**: Reusable UI components have been created for navigation, headers, footers, and other common elements.
